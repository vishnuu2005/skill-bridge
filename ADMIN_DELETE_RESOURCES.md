## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Backend Returns 404 on DELETE
**Cause**: Render hasn't redeployed with latest code yet

**Fix**:
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com/
2. Click on your **skillbridge-backend** service
3. Check **"Logs"** tab for deployment status
4. If not deploying, click **"Manual Deploy"** → **"Deploy latest commit"**
5. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete
6. Test delete endpoint again

### Delete Button Not Showing
**Cause**: Not logged in as admin

**Fix**:
1. Logout if logged in as regular user
2. Login with admin credentials (above)
3. Navigate to Education page
4. Delete button should appear

### Delete Fails with "Forbidden"
**Cause**: User is not admin

**Fix**:
1. Verify admin status by checking localStorage:
   ```javascript
   JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user'))
   ```
2. Should show `"isAdmin": true`
3. If not, run `node make-admin.js` to make user admin

## 📝 Testing via API (PowerShell)

### 1. Login to Get Token
```powershell
$body = @{email="admin@skillbridge.com";password="Admin@123456"} | ConvertTo-Json
$res = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://skillbridge-backend-wl2d.onrender.com/api/users/login" -Method POST -Body $body -ContentType "application/json" -UseBasicParsing
$token = ($res.Content | ConvertFrom-Json).token
$token
```

### 2. Get Resource ID
```powershell
$res = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://skillbridge-backend-wl2d.onrender.com/api/resources" -UseBasicParsing
$resources = $res.Content | ConvertFrom-Json
$resourceId = $resources[0]._id
$resourceId
```

### 3. Delete Resource
```powershell
$headers = @{ Authorization = "Bearer $token" }
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://skillbridge-backend-wl2d.onrender.com/api/resources/$resourceId" -Method DELETE -Headers $headers -UseBasicParsing
```

**Expected**: Status 200 with message "Resource deleted successfully"

---

## 🔐 Security Notes

1. **Only admins** can delete resources
2. **JWT authentication** required (token must be valid)
3. **Confirmation dialog** prevents accidental deletion
4. **Soft delete option**: Consider adding `isActive: false` instead of hard delete (optional enhancement)

---

## 🎉 Feature Complete!

Once Render redeploys the backend (check logs), the delete functionality will be fully operational!

### To Verify Backend is Updated:
1. Check Render dashboard logs
2. Test DELETE endpoint via API (PowerShell commands above)
3. Test via frontend delete button

### Current URLs:
- **Frontend**: https://skillbridge-7qtgkb8w7-vishnus-projects-74225a00.vercel.app
- **Backend**: https://skillbridge-backend-wl2d.onrender.com
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/vishnuu2005/skill-bridge

---

**Status**: ✅ Code deployed to GitHub & Frontend deployed. Waiting for Render backend redeploy (~2-5 min).
