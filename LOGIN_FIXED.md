# ✅ LOGIN ISSUE FIXED!

## 🔧 Problem Identified
The frontend's `AuthContext.js` was hardcoded to use `localhost:5000` instead of reading from the environment variable.

## ✅ Solution Applied
Updated the AuthContext to use the environment variable:
```javascript
axios.defaults.baseURL = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || 'http://localhost:5000';
```
