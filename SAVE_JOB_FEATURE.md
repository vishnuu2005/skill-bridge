## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Frontend (Jobs.js)
```javascript
// State Management
const [savedJobs, setSavedJobs] = useState([]);
const [message, setMessage] = useState('');
const [messageType, setMessageType] = useState('success');

// Save/Unsave Handler
const handleSaveJob = async (jobId) => {
  const isSaved = savedJobs.includes(jobId);
  
  if (isSaved) {
    await axios.delete(`/api/users/jobs/${jobId}/save`);
    setSavedJobs(savedJobs.filter(id => id !== jobId));
  } else {
    await axios.post(`/api/users/jobs/${jobId}/save`);
    setSavedJobs([...savedJobs, jobId]);
  }
};
```

### Backend API Endpoints

#### Save a Job
```
POST /api/users/jobs/:jobId/save
Headers: Authorization: Bearer <token>
Response: { message: 'Job saved successfully', savedJobs: [...] }
```

#### Unsave a Job
```
DELETE /api/users/jobs/:jobId/save
Headers: Authorization: Bearer <token>
Response: { message: 'Job unsaved successfully', savedJobs: [...] }
```

#### Get Saved Jobs
```
GET /api/users/saved-jobs
Headers: Authorization: Bearer <token>
Response: [Job objects with populated data]
```

### Database Schema (User Model)
```javascript
{
  savedJobs: [{
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'Job'
  }]
}
```

## 🎯 Button Styling

### CSS Classes
- `.btn-save` - Base save button style
- `.btn-save.saved` - Active/saved state
- `.message-banner.success` - Success notification
- `.message-banner.error` - Error notification

### Key CSS Features
- Gradient backgrounds for saved state
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Hover effects with scale and shadow
- Shimmer effect on hover
- Pulse animation when saved

## 🚀 Usage Statistics

- ✅ Persistent across sessions

### System Features:

## 🔒 Security

4. Ensure backend server is running

### Saved jobs not persisting:
1. Check MongoDB connection
2. Verify User model has savedJobs field
3. Check API endpoint responses
4. Clear browser cache and re-login

### Visual issues:
1. Check Jobs.css is loaded
2. Verify no CSS conflicts
3. Clear browser cache
4. Check responsive breakpoints
