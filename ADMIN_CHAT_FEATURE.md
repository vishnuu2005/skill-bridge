# 🎖️ Admin Badge in Chat - Feature Guide

## ✨ What's New

When an **admin sends a message** in chat, users can now **clearly see** that it's from an admin with a special **ADMIN badge** and distinctive styling!

---

## 🎨 Visual Features

### 1. **Admin Badge**
- **Pink/Red gradient badge** with "ADMIN" text
- Appears next to the sender's name
- Visible on **both admin's own messages** and **messages received from admin**

### 2. **Special Styling for Admin Messages**
- **Admin messages from others**: 
  - Pink/red border highlighting the message
  - Special shadow effect
  - ADMIN badge next to sender name
  
- **Your own admin messages**:
  - Pink/red gradient background (instead of purple)
  - ADMIN badge above your message
  - Distinct appearance from regular messages

---

## 📋 How It Works

### Backend Changes:
1. **Message Schema Updated** (`backend/models/chat.js`):
   - Added `isAdmin: Boolean` field to message schema
   - Defaults to `false` for regular users

2. **Message Sending** (`backend/controllers/chatController.js`):
   - When a user sends a message, their `isAdmin` status is captured
   - Stored in the database with each message

### Frontend Changes:
1. **Chat Component** (`frontend/src/components/Chat.js`):
   - Detects admin status from message data
   - Displays ADMIN badge for admin messages
   - Adds special CSS class `chat-message-admin`

2. **Chat Styling** (`frontend/src/components/Chat.css`):
   - **ADMIN badge**: Pink/red gradient with white text
   - **Admin message border**: Pink/red with shadow
   - **Admin own messages**: Pink/red gradient background
